# Angular Tutorial: First App

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

To begin with the Angular tutorial in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1.**Install Visual Studio Code (if you haven't already):**

- Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Download the installer for your operating system.
- Follow the installation instructions.

  2.**Install Node.js:**
- Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Download and run the installer for your operating system.
- Follow the installation instructions.

## Verifying Node.js and npm Installation

Once you've installed Node.js, you can verify the installation by running the following commands in your command-line interface (CLI):

1. Open your command-line interface
2. To check the version of Node.js installed, run:

```
 node -v
```

This command will output the version of Node.js installed on your system.

3. To check the version of npm (Node Package Manager) installed, run:

```
 npm -v
```

This command will output the version of npm installed on your system.

Note:If the version numbers are not displayed when running `node -v` or `npm -v`, you need to add the Node.

## Setting Up Angular CLI

After installing Node.js and npm, you'll need to install the Angular CLI globally on your system. Follow these steps to set up Angular CLI:

1. **Open your command-line interface (CLI):**
2. **Install Angular CLI globally:**

```
 npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This command will display the version of Angular CLI installed on your system along with other related information.

## Create a new Angular project using Angular CLI

```
ng new projectname
```

## Running the Git Repository

To run the project from a Git repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Git repository:**

   - Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. **Start JSON Server:**

   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Open a terminal within Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `json-server --watch db.json` to start JSON Server and watch the `db.json` file.
